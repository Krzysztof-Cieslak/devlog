# DevLog

Micro-blogging/note-sharing webpage build with Svelte.

## Why

This project has been created for three main reasons:

-   I wanted to create some space for
    micro-blogging/note-sharing - something more involved than writing a thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/k_cieslak), but
    without an expectation of creating a nicely redacted, "real" articles as in case of things I used
    to publish on the [blog](http://kcieslak.io)/[medium](https://medium.com/@k_cieslak)... for which I never have enough time.

-   I've always wanted to play with some of my ideas for improving the UX of the blogs focused on coding; I guess this is space as good as any other for experimenting with those ideas.

-   I wanted to play with a few technologies that I've never used before but which sounded interesting in theory:

            * [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
            * [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
            * [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
            * [utterances](https://utteranc.es/)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.


## Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer

I want your help. *No really, I do*.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
